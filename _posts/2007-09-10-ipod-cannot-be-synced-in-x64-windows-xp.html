As my desktop cannot boot Windows any more due to non-bootable SATA adapter, I need to use my another machine with XP x64 version to do the job.<br />After updating iTunes on it, I found that I can never sync the songs on my iPod, and it keeps trying and trying so that it became nearly unresponsive.<br />With some researching, it is due to x64 version of XP, which iTunes doesn't support, and some strange things will happen, so I am one of the victims.<br />Now I decided to use gtkpod for the task, it looks simple.
