2. Installation process<br />There are 2 methods I can think of, first is to use slightly modified Debian installer, to install a small base system first, and then use APT to install the remaining packages after first boot, or use chroot to install before first boot, if network is available, we can even install most updated packages from network. Advantage of this method is that the base system size is flexible, we can use a small and common base system for all or our products, and so hardware support is not a problem in all products.<br />Second method is to use a large tarball for the whole installation just like old version of M3, this can have a faster installation, but the disadvantage is that we need to maintain all products' tarball seperately.<br />I prefer the first method myself.
