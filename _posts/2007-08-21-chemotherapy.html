After 2 rounds of chemotherapy, father's lung cancer treatment has some progress.<br />1. The main cancer tissue collapsed from 3.x cm in diameter to 1.x cm in diameter, ie. 3/4 of the cell killed in 2 rounds.<br />2. There are some small spots of cancer tissue on the opposite side of lung, now there is none.<br />3. The white blood cell in his blood is still OK for next round of chemotherapy, which according to the doctor, is due to healthy body.<br />Of course, still need to keep the therapy until the tissue is small enough in order to do radioactive-therapy, which will kill most of the cancer cell at one time.<br />Anyway, it is still a good news.
