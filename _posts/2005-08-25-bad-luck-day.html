My office desktop always hang recently, so I guess the mother board has some problem, this morning I tried to replace it with another board, then, when I tested one and preparing to replace it, I found that my original board's RAM is DDR...
<br />After choosing another DDR RAM mother board, it works!
<br />But after lunch, the machine freezed and I can't turn on it anymore, so I need to find one more replacement board, after testing the board, I moved it to my seat and press power button, but... can't turn it on...
<br />I investigated it and finally found that the manual of the board has error, and I set the wrong switches, oh my god...
<br />Finally it works, hope it really works.
