Now I am using iBook at home to post this, why?<br />I've installed emerde on my home desktop, which was slackware 10, emerde is a tool to let slackware system make use of gentoo's portage system to install and keep track of new packages.<br />I was very happy when I can emerde many many things easily on my slackware desktop, but today I've done some silly things - I installed some very low level things like sysvinit and rc-scripts to the system, this made my system failed to bootup and has a lot of errors.<br />So I made up my mind, reinstall the whole system to Gentoo 2006.0, now still emerging X.org, hope can finish and can use before tomorrow.
