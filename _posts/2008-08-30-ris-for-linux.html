Some laptops don't come with CD/DVD-ROM, but they are bootable by network, in case people need to install Windows (XP/2003/Vista/2008), they need to use alternative method, like network installation - RIS.<br />RIS can be implemented with Linux + DHCP + TFTP, which is easy to setup.<br />http://oss.netfarm.it/guides/pxe.php
