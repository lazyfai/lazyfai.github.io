Just found a new plugin for Pidgin on internet, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msn-pecan/">msn-pecan</a> is a re-implementation of MSN protocol, which should support a newer MSN protocol, from the website it said:<br /><br />This is a fork of that code with a much faster development process.<br /><br />Features include:<br /><ul><li>Support for personal messages</li><li>Server-side storage for display names (private alias)</li><li>Partial direct connection support</li><li>Improved network IO</li><li>Improved error handling</li><li>Network issues tested with netem</li><li>GObject usage</li></ul>Now it is under testing, and see if it can be merged into pidgin package for Eee PC later.
