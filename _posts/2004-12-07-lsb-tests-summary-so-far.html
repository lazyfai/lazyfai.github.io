Results of running LSB test suite 2.0 on Thiz Easy Theatre:
<br />1. runtime test: 8 coreutils related failures, 1 well known failure and 1 unknown failure
<br />2. c++ test: all passed
<br />3. XWindow test: all passed
<br />4. pam test: 2 well known failures, 3 unknown failues
<br />
<br />so we need to due with pam test 3 unknown failures first, after that, runtime test unknown failure,
<br />but at this moment, no help from LSB mailing list yet... sigh.
