My desktop doesn't have floppy drive (and I think most of the people don't have too).<br />But my desktop BIOS has update, how to update it without using floppy?<br />We can use GRUB to load the disk image into ram disk to run the BIOS update. Method is:<br />http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/BIOS_Upgrade#Updating_via_Grub_and_a_Floppy_Image<br />Bascially GRUB will assign a ram disk and fill with the image file, and then boot using that as if it is a floppy disk.
