Long time since last time write blog about working.<br />Today is first working day in 2006, and of course, after a long holiday, will have holiday mood, but still can work for some meaningful tasks...<br />1. X.org in M3 package updated to 6.9.0 from backports project<br />2. TLD9 base will finish migrating soon too<br />3. After adding backports packages, mysql server can't start, finally found the reason, one of the option is obsoleted, fixed.<br />Hope tomorrow can get back the heart and start work hardly.
