Installed a Satellite server with a little bit difficulty in proxy configuration.<br />As the channel content is very large, I've downloaded it during weekend and put on USB disk, so no need to download for 2 - 3 days...<br />Tomorrow we will start the installation test, hope they can arrange testing machines.
