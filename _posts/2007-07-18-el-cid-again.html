Happy birthday to Cathy.<br />Today went El Cid for celebrating Cathy's birthday, food are nice but we thought that last year's was a little bit better...<br />We ate: garlic bread with tomato, spanish sausage, cabbage roll with cheese, large spawn penne and a special drink called Bacelona delight. But I could not feel the taste except lychee flavour in the drink.
