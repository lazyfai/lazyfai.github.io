As my pidgin has problem connecting ICQ recently, I have to rebuild my pidgin, and at the same time, I decided to give a try on Carrier (a fork of pidgin) which has a more active and speedy development.<br />But when I compile Carrier, it depends on WebKit, so I compiled also pango, cairo and WebKit in order to build Carrier.<br />I've heard that Safari - Apple's browser based on WebKit... to be exact, WebKit is open sourced by Apple, got 100 marks in ACID3, so atter building WebKit,...<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ZwYFGbHC6Q8/SGwrmV8nwkI/AAAAAAAACDc/xoCSF7jC60o/s1600-h/webkit-acid3.png"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ZwYFGbHC6Q8/SGwrmV8nwkI/AAAAAAAACDc/xoCSF7jC60o/s400/webkit-acid3.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5218594005941994050" border="0" /></a><br />What a nice result!<br />As well as testing Carrier and WebKit, I've tried another MSN protocol plugin for pidgin/carrier - msn-pecam, which is from the original developer of MSN plugin of pidgin, he doesn't like the slow pace and the attitude of pidgin team so he decided to make a seperated plugin for supporting MSN protocol, it seems to be working very well.<br />I will use Carrier + MSN-PECAM at the moment to see if it is more stable or not.<br /><br />URL:<br />Pidgin: http://www.pidgin.im/<br />Carrier: http://funpidgin.sourceforge.net/<br />MSN-Pecam: http://code.google.com/p/msn-pecan/
