I am going to make live CD version of MII, originally I want to base it on Morphix, which is modular version of knoppix, which I can add modules to it easily, but unfortunately, the latest version of Morphix has a new base, and the old tools to remaster the CD is not working now, so I decide to try to use back Knopphix as the base of MII live CD version, will start the test today.
