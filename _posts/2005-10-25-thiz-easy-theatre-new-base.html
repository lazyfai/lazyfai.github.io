Will probably give up, reasons:
<br />- not enough manpower, of course, now only me working on it
<br />- our program is too Haier/Hisense specific, even in the code level, so it is hard to merge our change into one program or even seperated packages, without serious modifications on different version
<br />- too much hardcoding things on the config files, etc, which bound to a specific vendor version
<br />- many utilities/helper functions are not packaged in the package files, so it is hard to trace back every single small script to be included in every package
<br />- really need to work with it later on? if not, it is wasting of manpower, which is limited, yes, highly limited
