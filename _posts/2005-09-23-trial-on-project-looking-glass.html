Looking Glass is a "3D desktop environment" developed by Sun, for its Sun Java Desktop, it is basically a Java3D application for handling the windows placement, resize, move, ie a window manager, and to be exact, something like KDE.
<br />Tested on 2 machine using the live CD provided by Sun, felt disappointed as one machine using ATI Radeon X300, Pentium-4, feel very jerky, and the other one is 1GHz Athlon, 256M RAM with GeForce 4, a bit better (strange result) but still very very jerky, maybe the minimum requirement is GeForce FX 5xxx serise with Pentium-4 4GHz, 4G RAM... :-)
