Reduced to single thread to handle all things!
<br />Memory footprint only around 16M, it is minimum as I believe.
<br />Features implemented:
<br />1. Backup hyr will be killed first, ie. pipelining
<br />2. Many search pathes modified to include marginally places
<br />3. Will consider parry and other can't practice skills too
