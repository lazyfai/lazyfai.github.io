First heard about facebook from a Egyptian colleague (Shrief) for viewing the photos of the trip with him and others.<br />After joining facebook, I found many Red Hatters there, and after that I also met many ex-colleagues. Today I asked several U-mates about facebook, and some of them have accounts!<br />Meeting new friends is amazing, but more amazing thing is meeting old friends which haven't meet frequently or even "disappeared" for a long time.<br />Facebook is such kind of thing, yes, really amazing.<br />http://facebook.com/
