After building the new desktop system, the old computer still has enough hardware to be used, so I would like to find something to install to it and use it as a media box or gaming machine for mother.<br />GeeXboX seems a good choice, it is a live CD for media player, like songs, movies.<br />Another choice is Advance CD, which is Advance MAME live CD, which is used for playing games.<br />See if I have time to build it next week.
