After looking for many documents, I have repartitioned my iBook's harddisk and reinstalled OSX on it. For the other partition, I installed the latest gentoo 2005.1, after installing gentoo, can't boot to OSX... but solved by using the OSX CD to recover it, my gentoo has nothing yet, will do it later, nice dual booting iBook.
