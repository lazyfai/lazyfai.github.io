Long time since last time working on weekend.<br />This saturday I was so busy. Firstly I need to bring mum to causeway bay for body check, at 9am.<br />After over an hour of waiting and checking, it is already 11am, we then go to restaurant for lunch, as I need to work in the afternoon.<br />Sent mum to bus stop for backing home, and then go to quarry bay to work.<br />Due to some misunderstanding and some missing information, the work was not very smooth, although it is supposed to be simple.<br />Finally finished at 8pm and went home after dinner with partners. What a long day!<br />And most trouble thing is I need to stand-by there on monday at 8am... So I probably need to wake up and then take bus without eating breakfast. Hope it will be a smooth day.
