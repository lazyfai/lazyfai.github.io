Install DesktopBSD for fun, it wrongly recognised my extended and logicial partition, after installing it, and making some updates, I tried to reboot the computer and then...<br />All my Linux partitions gone!<br />By using gpart, I can only rescue my root partition and swap partition, all the home directories gone...<br />Next time, when install new OS, remeber to backup the data!
