Partly Thizified, added menu layout support and themes support, now can load Haier, Hisense and Thiz themes successfully, next is to modify the behaviour to act like the old version.
<br />Missing things:
<br />- gallery, video interface
<br />- vcd/dvd player interface
<br />- tv support, with those missing scripts
<br />- music player interface
<br />- go to windows script
<br />- software suspend support
<br />- uninstaller
<br />- new kernel package
<br />- faster init scripts
