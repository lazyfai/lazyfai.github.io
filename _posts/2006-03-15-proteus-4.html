<a href="http://www.defaultware.com/proteus/">Proteus</a> - An instant messager for Mac OS X.<br />It costs over $10 USD before, now FREE.<br />I tried before, it is quite functional and with a  pretty outlook, I used to use Adium as it is free. Now I am trying to use proteus, if it is good, I'll switch to it.<br />Nice move.
