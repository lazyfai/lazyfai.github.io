Finally got the report of my father's situation from the doctor today.<br />Middle age of lung cancer, with bad cell on left lung, and some infection to the right lung.<br />According to the doctor, my father's heart has a little bit problem too, so a cutting is not possible,<br />only method is radioactive treatment now, which actually not 100% effective to the situation,<br />most of the time, the treatment can only slow down the development of the cancer, so that<br />the patient will survive for some more years.<br />Anyway, we all accepted the fact and not as unhappy as we think.<br />Enjoy every moment.
