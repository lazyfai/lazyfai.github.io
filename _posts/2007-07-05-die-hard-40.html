Went to see "Die Hard 4.0" tonight with a friend.<br />The film is OK, actually I haven't see Die Hard 1 to 3, so cannot do any comparison, the film is talking about computer network and hacking, and of course, police won finally. Most interesting thing is both Justin Long and Bruce Willis are Mac fans, Justin Long is even Mac advertisement actor! Mr Mac is the hacker, haha.<br />The action part is very nice, many explosion, fighting and exciting scenes. Worth seeing.
