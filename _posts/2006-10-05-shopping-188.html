Tonight went to Wan chai 188 with Wendy to buy DS lite for Josephine.<br />Finally bought $1500 with DS lite pink color, 1G mini SD, supercard mini SD with rumble.<br />However it is NOT flashed, when I try it at home, so silly me.<br />But luckily I have PASSME2, finally, I flashed it myself...<br />I also flashed my 2nd hand DS with flashme v7, can use my newly bought DSLink, and also it supports 4 level brightness.
