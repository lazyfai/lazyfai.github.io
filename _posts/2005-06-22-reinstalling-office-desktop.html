As my office desktop has been update and update for long period, many things are inconsistent now, seems a reinstallation is better for it, so I choose to install gentoo linux on it.
<br />Computer configuration:
<br />AMD Athlon Thunderbird 1.0GHz
<br />256Mb SD RAM
<br />40Gb Harddisk
<br />But in first day (monday), I wrongly chosen the compiler flag to use <em>-march=athlon-xp</em>, it made my computer very unusable, and I discovered it on tuesday, after changing the flag to <em>-march=athlon</em>, seems works fine, so I need to recompile all things, now mozilla, X.org and part of GNOME are ready, but I forgot one thing again, I have updated gcc to 3.4.x from 3.3.x, seems I need to recompile whole system again today, hope all programs will be ready tomorrow.
