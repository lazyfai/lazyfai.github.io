Today after I went to eat the famous 牛肉面，and then went to have meeting with TSMC (台積電) in 新竹。<br />We took the latest railway, Taiwan High Speed Rail (高鐵) to 新竹, very like Yuen Long, nearly nothing there, just some fields and pools.<br />On the meeting I need to present in Mandarin, so hard for me, I was not sure that they understand what I say or not, but looks like they are more puzzling than me...<br />After the meeting it was already 6:30pm and someone drove us to the rail station and we back to Taipei station to had a quick dinner there, and now I am resting in hotel.<br />Tomorrow there will be a session for me, so excited.
