At the beginning I think I need to output excel files by my program, so I searched a php function for spreadsheet manupulation.<br />Today I really need to write that part to output a form from the database, but I found that the format I need is OpenCalc (sxc) format... which is basically a zip archive containing some xml files.<br />After a brief search and no result, I decided to unzip the empty form and make a "template" so that I can use simple search and replace method to fill in the required field, and seems I've done most of the difficult part now!<br />Missing part is to delete record from database, and a simple UI for querying the data, like by time, by vender, by product, etc.<br />Happy new year!
