Another day has gone<br />I'm still all alone<br />How could this be<br />You're not here with me<br />You never said goodbye<br />Someone tell me why<br />Did you have to go<br />And leave my world so cold<br /><br />Everyday I sit and ask myself<br />How did love slip away<br />Something whispers in my ear and says<br />That you are not alone<br />For I am here with you<br />Though you're far away<br />I am here to stay<br /><br />But you are not alone<br />For I am here with you<br />Though we're far apart<br />You're always in my heart<br />But you are not alone<br /><br />'Lone, 'lone<br />Why, 'lone<br /><br />Just the other night<br />I thought I heard you cry<br />Asking me to come<br />And hold you in my arms<br />I can hear your prayers<br />Your burdens I will bear<br />But first I need your hand<br />Then forever can begin<br /><br />Everyday I sit and ask myself<br />How did love slip away<br />Something whispers in my ear and says<br />That you are not alone<br />For I am here with you<br />Though you're far away<br />I am here to stay<br /><br />For you are not alone<br />For I am here with you<br />Though we're far apart<br />You're always in my heart<br />For you are not alone<br /><br />Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'<br />And girl you know that I'll be there<br />I'll be there<br /><br />You are not alone<br />For I am here with you<br />Though you're far away<br />I am here to stay<br />For you are not alone<br />For I am here with you<br />Though we're far apart<br />You're always in my heart<br /><br />For you are not alone<br />For I am here with you<br />Though you're far away<br />I am here to stay<br /><br />For you are not alone<br />For I am here with you<br />Though we're far apart<br />You're always in my heart<br /><br />For you are not alone...
