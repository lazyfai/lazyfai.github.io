<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="date">From ubuntu forum:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">endersshadow</span>   November 7th, 2005, 01:03 AM<br /><br /></div></div><div class="posttext"><div style="text-align: center;">A quick HOWTO for making your own usplash in the GIMP:<br /></div><br />1. Make a new image 640x480.<br /><br />2. Go to Dialogs>Palettes and create a 16 color palette with your choice of colors and name it Ubuntu Splash. Make sure the following are in the right order (remember, index 0 is the first one):<br />Palette Index | Used For<br />-----------------------------------------<br />0             | Background color<br />0             | Text background color<br />1             | Progress bar foreground color<br />2             | 'Ok' text foreground color<br />4             | Progress bar background color<br />8             | Description text foreground color<br />13            | 'Failed' text foreground color<br /><br />3. Now that you've done that, go to Image>Mode and select Indexed.  Select "Use Custom Palette" and select Ubuntu Splash.<br /><br />4. Make it look how you want it to, and save it as ubuntu-artwork.png in your home directory. Taking it from there, you can start at step 3 of the original HOWTO (assuming you've installed the necessary packages). Make sure that you don't delete the original ubuntu-artwork.png if you want to keep it around!!<br /><br />:-D<br /><br />Edit: I figured I'd attach mine in case anybody likes a lot of dark green like I do...</div></div>
