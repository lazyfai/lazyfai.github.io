Change Thinkpad CPU DIY:<br />1. Remove screws on the back for keyboard, wrist rest and touch pad.<br />2. Remove wrist rest and touch pad, remember to detach the cable under the touch pad.<br />3. Move away the keyboard, no need to detach if you are brave enough, just move it a bit, so that you can touch the thing under keyboard.<br />4. Remove the cover of wireless antenna.<br />5. Remove screws for CPU fan and move it a bit to see the CPU.<br />6. Turn the screws for CPU lock 180" to release the CPU.<br />7. Change it and undo the above steps.<br /><br />I changed the CPU on T60 myself, now it changed from T2400 to T7600, speed boost and got 64bit mode enabled.<br />Forgotten to take pictures!
