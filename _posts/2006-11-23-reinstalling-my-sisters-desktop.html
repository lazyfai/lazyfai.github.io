Due to too many spy-ware infections, my sister wants to reinstall the whole system for her desktop computer, so I helped her to reinstall last night.<br /><br />1. Remove the old partition and repartition the harddisk.<br />2. Install Windows XP but no driver for the on-board LAN<br />3. Install the motherboard driver, in order to have network access<br />4. Update the Windows XP to SP2<br />5. Get all the motherboard drivers from ASRock website and install them<br />6. Install firefox, maxthon, messenger, MS Office<br />7. Update until nothing to update for the OS and Office<br /><br />Will continue tonight, to install antivirus, spyware protection and finally make a partition backup for easy reinstall later on.
