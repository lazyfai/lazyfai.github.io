Today I woke up a bit late as we are not hurry for event for the last day of the trip, we went to Beijing office at about 10am.<br />The Beijing office is nice, large and got many people, the people there are quite good and seems hard working.<br />We had lunch in the shopping mall under the office building and took some photos with the Beijing colleagues before we left. Ken cannot leave today as something suddenly need him to handle in Beijing. Poor Ken.<br />We left Beijing office and took taxi to airport at about 4pm.<br />Finally I got no time to shopping, I just bought some little gift for dad and mum in the airport duty free shop, and I type this on the plane. I am flying on the sky.<br /><br />PS. I post this when I arrived home
