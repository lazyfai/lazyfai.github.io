Due to hard disk crashing this year, I lost all email and gallery photos from 2004 to early 2005, this weekend, I got the backup CD to restore some of the photos from 2001 to 2004, and installed gallery 2.0 on my home server, quite many improvements from 1.5! Thanks to the friends, I got back some of the valuable photos in the gallery now, I've backup the gallery at once. :-)
