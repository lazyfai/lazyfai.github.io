Rhythmbox - The music management application for GNOME<br />Website: http://www.gnome.org/projects/rhythmbox/<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/rhythmbox/screenshots/rb-small.png"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://www.gnome.org/projects/rhythmbox/screenshots/rb-small.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I found this application very good recently. I have used it a few years before but it was ... functionless before, and now it is good enough for daily use!<br />The interface is clean, but it doesn't mean it has limited functions, I would describe it as "iTunes for Linux", not exactly iTunes but it can handle mp3, aac and other gstreamer supported media files.<br />I can also listen to podcast (important!) in rhythmbox, although the interface is not as polished as iTunes.<br />The online radio function is not necessary for me, as the channels there are mainly for US people.<br />It also supports iPod, so I can use the music library with my iPod, but I'm not decide to use it to handle my iPod yet, maybe later.
