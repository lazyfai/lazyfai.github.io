Today there are some foreigner colleagues came from Taiwan, Korea, US and Singapore, to have a sales training in Hong Kong office.<br />I have to hurry about some projects so I cannot join the training, in fact it is quite sales oriented which doesn't suit me though.<br />Finally we left office at 6pm to have a nice dinner in Central, afterward, Sherif brought us to an Egyptian bar to have drink and let us see "waterpipe", a special way to smoking. It is nice but I won't try...<br />Tomorrow will have training too, but I cannot join as well.
