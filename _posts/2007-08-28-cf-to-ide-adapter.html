Today I bought a CF to IDE adapter, in order to boot my computer from a CF card, why do so? The reason is complicated:<br />1. My computer only got IDE on board controller, I inserted a PCI SATA adapter<br />2. The BIOS cannot boot the computer from the SATA adapter<br />3. I was using IDE hard disk before, and now I got a SATA hard disk<br />4. I can move all data from the IDE hard disk to the SATA hard disk, but according to (2), it cannot boot<br />5. According to (1), I cannot use 2 hard disks on my computer<br />6. In conclusion, I need to find something to boot and then mount the SATA hard disk<br />7. CF to IDE adapter only costs $35 and it is bootable, so I decided to install a boot loader on a CF card and boot from it<br />Now I am still doing the data migration, afterward I can try boot it up.
