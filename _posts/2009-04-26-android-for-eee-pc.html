Google has released Android 1.5 this week.<br />I've tried Android on my Eee PC 701 before, using the guideline provided by cupcake, but seems it lacked something such as Eee PC specific kernel modules support and mouse support.<br /><br />New version of the guideline is more completed and I am trying to build it now.<br />http://code.google.com/p/patch-hosting-for-android-x86-support/wiki/BuildAndroidForX86Platforms
