SGI xfs is a good filesystem for database.<br />But if it got problem, it is nearly no way to fix.<br />My home desktop crashed several times recently by unproper shutdown, I found there is some error messages in booting. To prevent further problem, I tried to check and repair it (xfs), but after some "repairing", the problem even worst.<br />Finally I need to reinstall whole gentoo, it will takes 2 days to compile I think. In these 2 days I cannot use it yet. Poor.<br />But good news is that my /home partition has no problem and I changed all filesystem back to ext3 now, ext3 is slow but at least more well proved to work fine in most case.
