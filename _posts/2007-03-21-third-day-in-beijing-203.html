Woke up quite early in the morning, as the 2nd day kick off meeting will<br />be started at about 9am.<br />The morning session is quite boring and I nearly fall asleep.<br />After the same buffet lunch as before, we started the afternoon session, which is about team building. Unfortunately most of the guys didn't have interest on it and most of the time they are just talking on their own, or even left the room and talk outside. I saw the trainer, a girl, was a bit disappointed.<br />The training finished at about 6pm and we got a quick tour guide inside the "palance-like" epoch city, the scene was really nice!<br />We had dinner with Taiwan colleagues and the mainland office manager in 老四川飯店, the food was not expensive but considered very high class in mainland, we got 11 people but only costed $993.<br />I've seen on the taxi the most famous thing in Beijing including 紫禁城, 天安門 and 長安大街, although just a glance.<br />This night we stay in the same hotel as the 1st night, but in upgraded rooms which is something like serviced apartment, with kitchen and living room as well!
