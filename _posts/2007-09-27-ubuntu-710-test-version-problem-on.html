Just helped a friend to find a bug fix in Ubuntu 7.10 test version.<br />https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gparted/+bug/134712<br /><br />The error is cannot automount removable volume.<br />The cause is due to gparted, it will temporary disable automount in gnome when it is working.<br />But if it crashed or being killed, the temporary disable configuration file won't be removed, so automount is totally disable.<br />To fix, just remove it by hand, simple.
