Some possibilities:<br />- iBook upgrade from 512M to 1.25G, desktop unchanged (cost: ~$950)<br />- iBook upgrade from 512M to 768M and desktop upgrade from 512M to 1.5G ( cost: ~$1100)<br />- iBook boots with firewire harddisk which is faster, and upgrade to 768M memory, desktop unchanged (cost: ~$1000)<br />- iBook unchanged, buy Mac mini from my friend (cost: ~$2000)
