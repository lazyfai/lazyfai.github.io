<span style="font-weight:bold;">I'll be there</span><br /><br />You and I must make a pact<br />We must bring salvation back<br />Where there is love, I'll be there<br />I'll reach out my hand to you<br />I'll have faith in all you do<br />Just call my name and I'll be there<br /><br />I'll be there to comfort you<br />Build my world of dreams around you<br />I'm so glad that I found you<br />I'll be there with a love that's strong<br />I'll be your strength<br />I'll keep holding on<br /><br />Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter<br />Togetherness, well it's all I'm after<br />Just call my name and I'll be there<br /><br />I'll be there to protect you<br />With unselfish love that respects you<br />Just call my name and I'll be there<br /><br />If you should ever find someone new<br />I know she'd better be good to you<br />Cause if she doesn't and I'll be there<br />Don't you know, baby<br />I'll be there, I'll be there<br />Just call my name and I'll be there<br /><br />Video:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52d20PK_Kyk
