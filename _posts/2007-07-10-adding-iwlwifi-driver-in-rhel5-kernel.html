Adding iwlwifi driver in RHEL5 kernel<br /><p>From the patch at John's test kernel page:</p><p><br />http://people.redhat.com/linville/kernels/rhel5/</p><p><br />Added iwlwifi and mac80211 patches to RHEL5 kernel source, a new kernel has been built with support of intel wireless chipset. After a brief test, it works like old ipw3945d based driver, even support ipw4965.</p>
