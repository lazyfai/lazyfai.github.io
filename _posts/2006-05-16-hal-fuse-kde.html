<div style="text-align: left;">HAL - Hardware abstraction layer<br />FUSE - Filesystem in user space<br />HAL has no idea about FUSE mounts, and FUSE mounts are considered "unmounted" in HAL, so if we use NTFS project's FUSE ntfsmount program to mount NTFS partitions, it will be shown as "unmounted" in HAL and hence in KDE.<br />I've added some code to HAL to check if the file system is "fuse", then use other method to check the device and the mount points, as FUSE won't give HAL the mounted device's major and minor number, ie. the device file can't be retrieved.<br />But /proc/mounts has entry of it! So I make use of the entry to workaround the problem of HAL and FUSE. :)<br /> </div>
