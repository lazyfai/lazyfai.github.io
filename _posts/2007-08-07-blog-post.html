This morning a lady sitting next to me was having her breakfast on bus, and finished before departure, as the journey is nearly an hour, I don't want her to carry the empty bags all the way, so I offered to help her to throw litter (luckily there is rubbish bin on estate bus).<br />Nothing happened during the journey, but...<br />Finally I got off at 鵝頸橋, and she should got off next stop at SOGO, the last stop. On the way to office, I was thinking it is too good if she was the new comer in the company on my floor, as I knew there will be a new one.<br />When I was still thinking, or dreaming, suddenly I found that the lady was on the opposite side of the traffic light, waiting for green light, unbelievable.<br />Of course, nothing happened after that too, haha...
