Got the Sun Ultra 20 M2 for nearly 2 monthes, but I only have one monitor at home, today I went to buy a new monitor in Tuen Mun finally.<br />The new monitor is ViewSonic VA703b, costs $1490, a bit expensive but as I buy in Tuen Mun, saved some traffic and afford, so it is still OK for me.<br />But once connected, the screen has some problem, looks like the display has shifted to right and down a bit, after some debugging, it is due to a cheap VGA cable which comes with the switch box I previously used.<br />Now everything is working. But I use my old HP pavilion f50 on Sun box while using the new monitor on my old machine, why? Because the new monitor doesn't have DVI input. :)
