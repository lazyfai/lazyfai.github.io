Played with some high end machines today, including Blade server, SAN Storage.<br />Installed RHEL5 with virtualized guest OSes on it and do some tests.<br />Got some failures but I think it is mainly due to the underlying file system, or clustering<br />algorithm, no time to debug yet, maybe ask some experts later on.
