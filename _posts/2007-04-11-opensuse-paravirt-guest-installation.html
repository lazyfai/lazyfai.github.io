Started to install paravirt guest OpenSUSE 10.2 on RHEL5.<br />The procedure is "quite" straight forward, but the default boot ISO image for SUSE is not xen-capable, so we need to get the kernel-xenpae RPM and the install-initrd RPM, then use a script to extract the kernel and modules from kernel RPM and insert to the initrd for installation use.<br />The script works fine under RHEL5, and now the system is installing from internet, will check if it work tomorrow morning.
