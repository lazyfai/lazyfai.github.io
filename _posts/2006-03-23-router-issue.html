The dd-wrt firmware seems having a bug on my router, which made the home network down frequently (due to router reboot) over last 2 nights.<br />I tried to upgrade it to latest SP1 which supposed to fixed the bug, I was too happy when I found the firmware, so I update it using remote terminal...<br />I uploaded the full version (I use mini version before), after upload, the router failed and seems hang.<br /><br />When I back home, seems the router is "bricked"...<br />After finding some information, I use "boot wait" time and tftp to reflash the firmware, it works now, see if there are any reboot tonight. Hope me good luck.
