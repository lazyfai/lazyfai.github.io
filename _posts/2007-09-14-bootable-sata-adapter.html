Finally I found a shop in 298 selling bootable SATA adapter, the shop keeper is a 4x years old man but he is very experienced computer guru, we talked a bit on adapter too.<br />The adapter is very cheap, only $105 with 2 SATA port, the chipset is Initio 1622, with a boot ROM supporting RAID0 and 1, when I plugged in the adapter and boot, wow! I saw the RAID BIOS, which means it should be a bootable adapter.<br />Normally a bootable adapter costs nearly $200 as I saw those Magic Pro adapter featuring Silicon Image chipset.<br />Although the Linux kernel driver said it is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL, looks like it is ok to boot and use at the moment, so happy.
