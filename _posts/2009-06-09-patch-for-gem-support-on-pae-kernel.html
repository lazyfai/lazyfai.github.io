My desktop board is Intel based, and with newer Intel XWindow driver, it makes use of kernel GEM feature, but this doesn't work in PAE kernel as I have 4G of memory.<br />Finally someone released a patch for the issue, which ensure the memory allocation is correct for GEM in the kernel.<br />http://www.mail-archive.com/dri-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg40319.html
