Suddenly have some idea about development of TLD9.<br />1. What should we do with TLD9 at this moment?<br />I think we have 3 choices, first is give up TLD9 development due to lack of manpower.<br />Second choice is to start from one of the distribution, eg. Debian stable or Ubuntu stable, and then branch it. After branching, mirror the whole distribution and just ignore any update of it afterward, so that all of the changes are made by ourselves only. This can avoid the case that we may have slower development, and then our things give overwritten by the original distributions.<br />Third choice is use the same method as TLD7, get a snapshot like Debian unstable or Ubuntu unstable first, then rebuild all of the packages with our modifications, then we will have exactly no interaction with the original distribution, advantage of this choice is that we can update in any frequency, in any speed, but the workload will be heavier and we need to keep updating it for at least one to two generation before the end-of-life of this version.<br />Personally I prefer the second choice, but if our development is in slow pace, third method is preferable, just have heavier workload at the very beginning.<br />(to be continued)
