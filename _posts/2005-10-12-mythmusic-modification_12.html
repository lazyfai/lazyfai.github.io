- detecting of file/directory name and id3 tag implemented
<br />- layout of directory view now show correct filename in correct encoding
<br />
<br />Method to solve Big5/GB2312/UTF-8 in same place:
<br />1. get the string, which can be filename, directory name or id3 tag field
<br />2. assume it is GB2312 encoding, convert it to UTF-8
<br />3. assume the output is UTF-8, convert the output back to GB2312
<br />4. if final output string is same as the original one, it is GB2312 encoding
<br />5. repeat the process with Big5 instead of GB2312
<br />6. if still different, it maybe UTF-8 encoding originally, just use it
