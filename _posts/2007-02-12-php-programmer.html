I need to write a web program for my company, to process some form data (in spreadsheet) to database, and then manipulate them, like modifying information, adding additional columns and generate reports.<br />As a web program, I consider PHP as it is not difficult to write and can connect to database easily.<br />This is the 3rd PHP program in my life, it already has many new functions that I never use, like file uploading, html form processing and external library to parse excel files.<br />Most interesting is, I seldom write program in the previous company but write a lot here. And I still can write nice programs, yeah!
