1. Get dapper based Ubuntu live CD, either ubuntu, xubuntu or kubuntu will do.<br />2. Copy all the files from CD to a directory.<br />3. The system need to have squashfs-tool and squashfs kernel module.<br />4. Go to cd:/casper/, mount the filesystem.squashfs to a directory.<br />5. Copy the files out from that directory to a new directory.<br />6. chroot to the resultant directory.<br />7. Edit the /etc/apt/sources.list to point to desired location, eg. your own repositories.<br />8. Use dpkg/apt to add/remove/upgrade packages in the system.<br />9. exit the chroot environment.<br />10. Use mksquashfs to compress the chroot environment back to a new filesystem.squashfs.<br />11. Replace it and burn a new CD, then you can have your customized live CD!
