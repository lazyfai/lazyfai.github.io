Spent 2 days to download the whole DVD image, and then need around an hour to patch the image for hardware checking, then half hour to burn DVD, finally I got a DVD of OSX/x86!<br />Installed on a shuttle Pentium 4 PC, quite smooth, but the on board LAN (Boardcom 5578) not working, need add Realtek 8139 to go online, so far so good, test more later on.
