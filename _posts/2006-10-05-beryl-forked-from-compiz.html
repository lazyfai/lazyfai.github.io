Long time since the last time trying aiglx.<br />Recently nvidia has released a new version of Linux driver, which can support aiglx/compiz well, so I have installed and tried to run it, after some work done, it turned out to be a very pretty and quite smooth desktop environment.<br />Compiz has forked to a new project call beryl too, the forum addrress is:<br />http://forum.beryl-project.org/<br />Let me find some good themes for use in beryl :-)
