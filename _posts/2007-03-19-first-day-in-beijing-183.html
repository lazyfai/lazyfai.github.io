Arrived Beijing at 4pm with TW colleagues, it is SO COLD in Beijing.<br />We took taxi to hotel, the hotel is not very good but acceptable.<br />After settled down, we went to hot potting in 東來順, but I felt unwell and ate very little.<br />We went to have feet massaging after dinner, and after massaging, felt well again!<br />Slept at about 00:30, good day!
