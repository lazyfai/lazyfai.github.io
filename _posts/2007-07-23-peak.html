Went to the peak with Taiwan colleague tonight for dinner and sightseeing.<br />Actually we should go by peak tram, but too many people queuing, so changed to taxi... no feel...<br />Had a rich and expensive dinner in restaurant on the peak, and went to see the harbour view as well.<br />Back to MTR station by taxi too.<br />Next time need to go by peak tram!
