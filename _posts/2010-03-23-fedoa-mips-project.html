My new project in Fedora, basically a <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/MIPS">port</a> of Fedora to MIPS computers as a secondary architecture, for myself, I have a Loongson 2f box from <a href="http://www.lemote.com/">Lemote</a><br />I have already made Fedora 11 packages and root filesystem which is working fine on my box, currently rebuilding Fedora 12, (hopefully) it will be ready before Fedora 13 release date.
