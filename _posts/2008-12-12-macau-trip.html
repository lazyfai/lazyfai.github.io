Had a very simple trip to Macau, arrived Macau at 10am, originally I assume I have to work until 5-6pm for setting up the most complicated thing - Satellite server.<br />The machine is very very fast and the longest process, originally need 3-4 hours, finished in 2 hours, so lucky!<br />Finally I can leave at 4:30pm, far earlier than expected.
