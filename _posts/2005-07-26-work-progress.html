Gallery will be given to BJ colleagues to work with, for the final fine tuning.
<br />I have started working on video playback, the plan is to integrate ( for the code ) video playback function to gallery interface and use the same interface code to work for the video playback as well.
<br />Now the progress is able to modify the package to make both libmythgallery.so and libmythvideo.so, good progress for first day!
