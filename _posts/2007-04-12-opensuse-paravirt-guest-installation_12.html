After installation of OpenSUSE with domU kernel and initrd, the resultant system cannot boot!<br />Done some searching and seems it is related to grub config file, it can handle xen kernel but it wrote an entry for booting as dom0 mode, not domU mode.<br />I edited the entry and then it can boot successfully... in text mode, the reason is that SuSE's kernel has no xen framebuffer support, so it can only run serial console.<br />I copied the RHEL5 kernel to the SuSE filesystem and now it can boot into graphical mode!<br />Tried live migration and it works too, very good POC.
