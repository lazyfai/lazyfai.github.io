My home desktop equipped with a Initio SATA adapter.<br />Only a few Linux distributions support it, including Ubuntu 7.04.<br />I am using Gentoo on it, as the kernel is customizable, it supports my desktop too.<br />Today I want to try install Ubuntu 7.10 for testing, but it is so strange that it cannot find my hard disk for installation.<br />After dmesg and modprobe, I found that the sata_inic162x is disabled by Ubuntu, not by any configuration but the module itself stop from initializing an "unstable" adapter...<br />No luck today yet.
