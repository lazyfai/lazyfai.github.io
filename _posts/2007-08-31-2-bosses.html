Today is my Hong Kong boss last day in company, and also the Beijing boss came to Hong Kong for handover and some meetings.<br />So we have activities to farewell HK boss and welcome BJ boss.<br />For farewell we went to Karaoke in CEO, and for welcome we went to happy valley to have seafood dinner, both nice!
