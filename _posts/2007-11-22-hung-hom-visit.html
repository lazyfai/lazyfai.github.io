Gi's home finally finished the 2 months revocation, with a whole new look. Tonight we went to visit and see the new look, it is nicer than before and get more space, as it is tidy now.<br />Went to hot pot and met new friend - Tik, which worked quite close to my home, I wish I can work in Tuen Mun too!
