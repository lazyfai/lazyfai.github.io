http://download.tuxfamily.org/fedoraxgl/<br />This is a web site for Xgl on Fedora 5, 6, 7.<br />As my ThinkPad T60 uses ATI display, and AMD still hasn't release a AIGLX supported driver for Linux, people said we need to use Xgl for that, after some search, I found this project, made RPMs for RHEL 5 now.
