It should be 1st of October, but it is still ok for a birthday dinner with my old friend Anita.<br />Tonight we had a dinner in Tsim Sha Tsui, PizzaExpress, I thought it should be similar to Pizza Hut but it is not, they only provide pizza, spaghetti and cakes, and it is not cheap... haha... But the food are all very nice! Forgot to take photo!
