Thanks Andrew for bringing his own TV set to office, but I found that, the signal from the building is OK! sigh, that means, the problem should be on the TV tuner card, but seems not related to Linux driver, because even use Windows driver, or a well-known working TV tuner card, we can see nothing but snowing screen.
