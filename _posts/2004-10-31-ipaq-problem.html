My iPAQ (thanks Anna) is crashed due to updating OPIE to unstable version and no enough free space, when I want to reinstall Linux on it, the boot loader serial console doesn't work! Finally I found that it is the cable's bad contact, not due to damaged port on the iPAQ, and so I can reinstall it successfully.
