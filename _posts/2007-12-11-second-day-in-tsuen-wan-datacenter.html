Still working in Tsuen Wan datacenter today.<br />Today's task is to do some update test and teach them how to use Satellite, but the process of getting a machine is SO SLOW, most of the time was waiting and waiting.<br />Left there at noon and back to office to tidy up things to go Taiwan tomorrow.
