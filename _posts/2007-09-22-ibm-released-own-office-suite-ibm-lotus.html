Being a part of Lotus Notes, IBM released the document editing part of it, called IBM Lotus Symphony, which is very similar to OpenOffice.org, including Document, Presentation and Spreadsheet as expected.<br />Don't know if it is based on OpenOffice.org or not, but IBM announced to join OpenOffice.org development last week, and release an own version this week, quite strange.<br />Downloaded and installed on my old Pentium 4 2.4GHz machine running Gentoo Linux with 1G RAM, it took a long time to load and the respond is quite slow, maybe due to its java program nature.<br />Not much compatible with chinese file name, but the font display is nice and it can open most OpenOffice.org documents like my presentations, text files and spreadsheets.<br />Worth a try!<br /><a href="http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/home.jspa">IBM Lotus Symphony</a>
