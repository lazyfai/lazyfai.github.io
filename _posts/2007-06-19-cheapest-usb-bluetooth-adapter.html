I have been finding USB bluetooth adapter for quite a long time, but most of the adapter I saw were around $150 in price, which is quite expensive for a small pieces of hardware.<br />Today I saw a very cheap USB bluetooth adapter in Tuen Mun, a small computer shop, only costs $49! And now I can get back all the photos on my phone.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ZwYFGbHC6Q8/RnegC-813NI/AAAAAAAAAY0/rTDbQD_A87w/s1600-h/DSC00001.JPG"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ZwYFGbHC6Q8/RnegC-813NI/AAAAAAAAAY0/rTDbQD_A87w/s320/DSC00001.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5077703078001892562" border="0" /></a>
