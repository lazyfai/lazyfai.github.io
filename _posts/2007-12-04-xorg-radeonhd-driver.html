Today I found that I forgot to use the latest AMD display driver on my RHEL 5.1 xen kernel, as I haven't updated the kernel fglrx driver and the Xorg driver after updating kernel, luckily I still have method to use it for demo, no need to use Windows. :-)<br />After demo, I found that I need to find another driver (open source driver) for my T60, and as I remember there is a new open source RadeonHD driver, I am not sure it can be used on my T60 too, so I tried and it works! Now I can get rid of that closed source driver totally, and it should be more stabler as well.
