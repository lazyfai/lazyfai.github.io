Today Michael Tiemann, the god of open source, has come to Hong Kong to have visit.<br />I met him in the morning in office, he sit near me and borrowed my laptop to make the slides for presentation.<br />And we went to Poly University, Department of Computing to have a talk on open source software.<br />The speech is nice and there was respond too.<br />After that we took bus back to Causeway Bay to have lunch, not like the other US guy, he like chinese food (點心) and we all full.<br />He got some phone interview after lunch and then will leave Hong Kong tomorrow. Of course, we grabbed the chance to take a photo with him. :-)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ZwYFGbHC6Q8/Rw-a9Fu4XRI/AAAAAAAAAxA/7zHSTWCF810/s1600-h/DSCF1596.JPG"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ZwYFGbHC6Q8/Rw-a9Fu4XRI/AAAAAAAAAxA/7zHSTWCF810/s320/DSCF1596.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5120481675645050130" border="0" /></a>
