As Debian looks quite boring and ... outdated in package list, I would like to reinstall the Linux on my iBook.<br />I've tried Ubuntu, Fedora, Gentoo on it, originally I want to try YellowDog, but cannot download for a whole night, so I switched to download OpenSuSE, see if it is good.<br />After downloading the 3.7 GB DVD image, burnt and tested, oops, the DVD cannot boot on my iBook, strange, after several trials, I decided to download the network install CD (88MB in size) and use network to install from the DVD.<br />But the network installation is very slow, and I found that I can choose media instead of network in installation source, so I use network install CD to boot and change to the burnt DVD, and it worked!<br />Now updating the whole system, should be finished in half hour.
