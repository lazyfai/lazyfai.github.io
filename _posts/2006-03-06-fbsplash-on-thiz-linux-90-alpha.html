Followed the instruction on <a href="http://jdurand.home.cern.ch/jdurand/fbsplash.html">fbsplash on debian/sid</a> and built splashutils and miscsplashutils on Thiz Linux 9.0 alpha, and converted Thiz Linux bootsplash theme into fbsplash theme, seems it works partly, with some tweaks in the initrd.img.<br />I done this my adding a mknod instruction to make back the device node /dev/fbsplash in /usr/bin/splash_geninitramfs and do mkinitrd followed by concating the initrd image generated by splash_geninitramfs.<br />In grub menu.lst file, use "video=vesafb:ypan,1024x768-32 splash=silent,fadein,theme:tld quiet CONSOLE=/dev/tty1" to enable the splash.<br />Remember to install udev to make the splash appear after bootup.<br />Also, /etc/splash/currect is a symlink to the currect theme directory!
