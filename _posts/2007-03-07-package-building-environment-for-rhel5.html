To build clean packages for RHEL5, we need to use "mock" from Fedora project.<br />1.Get a local mirror of RHEL5 repository, for yum to get packages from, assume we placed the RPMs on /var/ftp/pub/rhel5-local/RPMS<br />2. Install "createrepo" and "mock" packages from Fedora.<br />3. Run createrepo /var/ftp/pub/rhel5-local/RPMS/, this will create a local repository.<br />4. Start ftp daemon and allow anonymous login, ftp root set to /var/ftp/<br />5. Go to /etc/mock/, copy FC6's configuration to RHEL5, and edit it to point to the local repository, and set the default symlink to RHEL5<br />6. Get "buildgroups" repository from Fedora project, RHEL5 version of buildgroups packages, add to local repository too.<br />7. Then we can use "mock init" to test for the repository, this will create a buildroot and install the base system on it.
