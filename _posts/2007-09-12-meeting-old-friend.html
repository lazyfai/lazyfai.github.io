Met an old secondary school friend tonight.<br />Suddenly want to meet some people that have little contact over many monthes, so I SMS'ed them on monday to see if anyone free, got her respond at once, so I arranged a dinner for some other old friends too.<br />Had a nice buffet dinner in Kwai Fong "Relaxing Tea House", it is not cheap but a nice dinner, recommended.
