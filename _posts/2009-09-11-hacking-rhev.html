RHEV is coming live. But most of the functions are still under construction, including parameters for better performance.<br />And for customer test, we need to do performance enhancement, after some study, we found that some modules are even missing from the hypervisor... While waiting for engineering team, we try to modify KVM parameters first. There is no straight forward method, finally I tried to modify the source and it works. :-)<br />The customer will test for performance in next week, hope everything works fine and we can finish a big deal.
