Today annual leave, got the smart ID card, and handled the octopus auto refill plan, then go to Golden to buy RAM for my iBook.<br />After walked for some shops, I found Samsung 1Gb DDR-333 notebook RAM, price is $895, and finally, I went to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">black shop</span> - <span style="font-style: italic;">Centralfield</span> to buy, the price is even lower - $855! After a brief test, I paid and left, without any shopping, out of my expectation!<br />Now running on 1.25Gb RAM, so smooth, but still a bit laggy, maybe due to slow speed 4200 rpm harddisk, which is not quite likely to be upgraded.
