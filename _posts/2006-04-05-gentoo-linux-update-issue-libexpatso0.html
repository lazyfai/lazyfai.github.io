In a recent update on expat library in gentoo portage, libexpat.so.0 changed to libexpat.so.1, this change breaks quite a lot of packages, after a brief research, I try to fix it by:<br />revdep-rebuild -X --library=libexpat.so.0<br />This instructs emerge to rebuild those packages which depend on libexpat.so.0, so that they will be updated to link against libexpat.so.1<br />Still emerging, let's see any problem after that.
