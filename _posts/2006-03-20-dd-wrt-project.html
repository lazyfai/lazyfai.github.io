<a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/">dd-WRT</a> project is an open source project to reimplement router firmware for Linksys routers, and new version even support my buffalo router! (WBR-G54 is supported, but mine is WBR-B11, which is 99% same as G54, so I bravely give it a test, haha)<br />After reading some passages in forum and wiki, I downloaded the generic firmware, edit it and ... Flash!!<br />After a minute, my router is up and running again! Now I can add many many functions to it easily, even changing the kernel! Great project.<br /><img src="http://static.flickr.com/56/115323185_0a0939e6e8_m.jpg" />
