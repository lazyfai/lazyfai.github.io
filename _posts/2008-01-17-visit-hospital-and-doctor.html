This morning I took a leave and go to visit doctor in hospital with parents, my father's lung cancer has become smaller and smaller due to chemotherapy, from 3cm in diameter to about 2cm.<br />So now he is going to undergo next step - radiotherapy, which is something like Xray but concentrated to a point to kill to cancer cells.<br />Today doctor talked a little bit about the process and it will takes one month for one period, monday to friday, everyday takes half an hour for therapy, and rest for weekend, do this for three weeks and rest for one week. He needs to do about 2 - 3 periods first and afterward, receives a check to see the effect.<br />Hope this is useful.<br />For myself, I visited doctor afterward for my voice, and took many medicines home.
