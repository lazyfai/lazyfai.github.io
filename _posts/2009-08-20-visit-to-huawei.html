Today I went to Huawei office in Shenzhen to help them install RHEV, our new virtualization product there, to let them to try and evaulate. The work are not very smooth, but finally done on schedule.<br />The site is VERY large, simliar to the size of Tuen Mun, and divided into different regions, like estates, and every block of building is as large as a big shopping mall like Olympian City...<br />Most impressive is the canteen, which has nearly 1000 seats I guess, very large indeed!
