Finally found the reason for missing mp3 decoder in xine-lib...<br />Ubuntu people REMOVED it from the source! So the source in ubuntu is not the real xine-lib, now I grabbed the real xine-lib and started to build it.<br />Hope can fix the multimedia support in TLD tomrrow.<br /><br />Next is the screensaver and other eye candies.
