Work done so far:
<br />- Sort button, USB button, CDROM button, Quit button
<br />- Mouse handling
<br />- Shortcut key handling
<br />- Load directory and caption function
<br />- Chinese l10n
<br />- Video function and playback
<br />
<br />Todo:
<br />- Dependency checking in package file, add those external programs to dependency list
<br />- Seek forward and backward not working yet
<br />- Speed improvement
<br />
<br />Also, for MythMusic, just started. I think need 3 days for porting at least.
<br />For MythDVD it should be more easy.
