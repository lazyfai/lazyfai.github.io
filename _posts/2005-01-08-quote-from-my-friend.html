"...If you hang on to a feeling after there's nothing for it to do, 
<br />it would be rather inclined to go bad, wouldn't it? 
<br />I know it sounds romantic, but then such a lot of the things 
<br />that people used to think romantic were a bit rotten in the middle. 
<br />Besides, who wants to spend their whole life being sad 
<br />about something they can't have?"
